# To Do App

Note that for this app to work properly the express server should be ON:

In [gitHub repo](https://github.com/GDaniel96/todo-server) you can find the Node.js app that you will need to download and run the below commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This is a React-based To-Do app project. The application is built with create-reactapp that consumes a custom REST API that provides basic CRUD functionality.

The app uses Axios for making the requests. Simple CSS was used for styling, and the library framer-motion facilitated the process for transitions and animations.

The backend is a Node.js application made with Express that handles all the CRUD operations.

Tech stack:
* React with create-react-app
* Axios
* Framer-Motion
* Node.js
* Express
